                                <p>Intro:</p>
                                    <p class="indented">This story is about a prophet named Enos. Not much is known about him and few principles are taught directly in his brief book but it contains a lot of good principles if the reader is thorough. This story is simple, brief, yet powerful. Enos is the author of this book.</p>
                                <p>Summary:</p>
                                    <p class="indented">Enos up until the start of the book has been troubled in his soul. He seeks to understand God and be forgiven of his sins. He then prays in mighty prayer until he is answered. God tells Enos that He is forgiven of his sins. Enos then prays for the welfare of his people and God tells Enos that He will help them according to their diligence in keeping His commandments. Enos prays similarly for his enemies, the Lamanites, that they should receive a record of scripture and be brought back to God. God answers and says that He will in His own time.</p>
                                    <p class="indented">After the conclusion of his prayer, Enos then goes out to preach and the record closes with his testimony.</p>
                                
                                <p>Principles:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>When repenting, we should have faith that God can forgive.</li>
                                        <li>We are forgiven through faith in Christ.</li>
                                        <li>The Spirit of God causes one to feel love for friends and enemies alike.</li>
                                        <li>God will help us according to our diligence in keeping His commandments.</li>
                                        <li>Asking in faith leads to answers.</li>
                                        <li>God answers in His own time.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                
                                <p>Applications:</p>
                                <p class="indented">While there are many unique applications of the principles of this story, here is a list of possible applications that match the principles:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Some people who have gone through repentance tend to hold onto the guilt that weighed them down even after they have been forgiven. While one shouldn’t just “forgive themselves” they shouldn’t continually feel guilty about what they’ve done after they have been forgiven by God. To do this, one should develop faith in Christ and His atoning power.</li>
                                        <li>Because we are forgiven through faith in Christ, we should seek to have faith in Him. One can develop this faith by continually praying for more faith, being humble, and sincerely searching through scripture. Through this, one will gain more faith and will be forgiven.</li>
                                        <li>This is a common principle taught by the savior but it is not easy to live. To achieve this sincerely, one should pray to God for His Spirit to feel His love for all.</li>
                                        <li>This principle is fairly simple to apply, keep His commandments. Live them and try to learn why we should love them.</li>
                                        <li>This principle tends to lead some to believe that faith is some reality-bending power that we can obtain. That is not the case, faith leads to answers in God’s time and in what way He dictates. To apply this principle, one should seek to develop faith and ask God sincere questions. God will answer those prayers in His time and manner. God can answer prayers in a plethora of different ways.</li>
                                        <li>This principle is also difficult to apply, but one should seek to obtain a more patient mentality and understand that God knows what is best for us. One can apply this principle by remembering it especially when they are losing faith or patience. This principle also takes a fair amount of humility to become a mindset or mentality.</li>
