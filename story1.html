                                <p>Intro:</p>
                                    <p class="indented">This story is about a group of brothers who are commanded to accomplish a seemingly impossible task. Through trial and error, they eventually succeed. There are only a couple of principles taught directly to the audience, the remainder are inferred or left for the reader to interpret. Nephi, the righteous brother, is the author of this story. </p>
                                <p>Summary:</p>
                                    <p class="indented">Lehi and his family traveled out of Jerusalem, making camp a fair way away from their home. While at their camp, Lehi has a vision where he is told to send his sons, Laman, Lemuel, and Nephi, back to retrieve the brass plates. These plates hold books of scripture, the commandments, and the law of Moses. His sons go back to Jerusalem to attempt to retrieve the brass plates from their current owner, Laban.</p>
                                    <p class="indented">Laban is a powerful, greedy man whom the sons fear. Laman attempts to convince Laban to give Lemuel and his brothers the plates Laban refuses and casts Laman out. The brothers are discouraged, but Nephi insists and convinces them to gather all their wealth to try to barter with Laban. After Laban sees their wealth, he sends his guards after them to attempt to kill them all while keeping their riches. The brothers escape from Laban’s servants but lose all of their riches. Laman and Lemuel get angry with Nephi and beat him until an angel visits and tells them to stop. </p>
                                    <p class="indented">Nephi attempts to encourage his doubting brothers again but fails. He then goes again into Jerusalem relying on God to guide him. While traveling through, Nephi stumbles across Laban who is passed out drunk. The Spirit commands Nephi to slay Laban and Nephi refuses. The Spirit again commands Nephi to kill Laban and Nephi ultimately obeys. Nephi then disguises himself in Laban clothing and retrieves the brass plates. Nephi then returns to his brothers and they all return to Lehi who rejoices at their return. The story concludes with Lehi prophesying about the brass plates and about how the Lord preserved his sons in this journey. </p>
                                <p>Principles:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>God prepares a way for us to fulfill His commandments.</li>
                                        <li>God may not make the trial easy or the answer clear.</li>
                                        <li>People can remain hard-hearted even after a visitation of an angel.</li>
                                        <li>The Lord will guide you if you let Him.</li>
                                        <li>It is vital to teach children the commandments.</li>
                                        <li>It is important to have/keep a record.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                <p>Applications:</p>
                                <p class="indented">While there are many unique applications of the principles of this story, here is a list of possible applications that match the principles:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>When tempted, remember that God has a way prepared for you to succeed. Also, when given a task or challenge, remember that God has a way prepared for you to accomplish it. He doesn’t give commandments we can’t keep.</li>
                                        <li>This one is not easy, but gain the mentality that just because you do the right thing doesn’t mean that your life will be easy or that you’ll receive all the answers you want. This way of thinking will prevent a lot of potential heartache or anger toward God.</li>
                                        <li>Hard evidence does not give you a testimony, anything can be rationed away or ignored. For you to gain a testimony you need to be humble. Then you’ll be given faith and a testimony in God’s due time.</li>
                                        <li>God may not give us clear directions or answers so we should have faith and humility enough to follow His directions or guidance after we have done all that we can. A way to apply this to regular life would be to come up with solutions or plans when you can, choose one, and ask God if that idea is good or acceptable to Him. </li>
                                        <li>The theme of teaching children the ways of God appears multiple times throughout the scriptures. We should teach our children if we have any, the ways of God and His commandment. However, we should always remember that it is ultimately up to them whether or not they accept it. How you go about this is up to you.</li>
                                        <li>Thankfully, the scriptures are formatted in such a way now that we don’t need to worry too much about losing the scriptures. However, we receive scriptures of our own through revelation, so we should write down the revelations we receive. </li>
                                    </ol>
