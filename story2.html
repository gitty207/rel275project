In short, Nephite prophets and missionaries had gone to Lamanite lands and converted thousands of Lamanites. The Lamanites declared religious freedom throughout their lands for the first time but not all believed in the gospel or such a cause. Those who are converted refuse to sin at all, preferring to die as opposed to defending themselves. The authors are likely Aaron and Mormon.</p></div>

                            <p>Principles:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Apostates are closed off to the word of God. They live in a worse state than those in ignorance.</li>
                                        <li>We must do all that we can to repent, God will remove the guilt or stain of the sin.</li>
                                        <li>The Anti-Nephi-Lehis put their sins far away from themselves.</li>
                                        <li>God can consecrate tragedy to righteous purposes.</li>
                                    </ol>
                            <p>Applications:</p>
                                    <p class="indented">While there are many unique applications of the principles of this story, here is a list of possible applications that match the principles:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>As you can see from the story, the apostates were worse than the Lamanites. They were colder and far more hard-hearted than anyone else. You should seek to come to a true understanding of the gospel and ask God if it is true. If you’re converted, strive to upkeep your testimony and your daily habits of obedience, prayer, and study.</li>
                                            <li>This is an incredibly important principle to follow. We can’t expect God to simply remove a sin or bad habit from our lives, we must seek to remove it ourselves and then God will not find us guilty of that sin if we obtain forgiveness. We have to identify our sins, find ways to remove them, and find something to fill that void. This will vary from person to person, but one should seek to do all they can to remove sin from their lives and turn to God.</li>
                                            <li>In the story the Anti-Nephi-Lehis buried their swords deep, they didn’t just put them away. We should do likewise with our sins. We should put them far away so that we cannot be as tempted by them and so that we can turn to God more fully. Again, this will vary from person to person.</li>
                                            <li>We should have the mentality that God can take even bad situations and use them for righteous purposes. It’s easy to lose sight of God and His works especially when tragedy strikes. If one is humble and has this mentality, one will become more faithful and confident in God.</li>
                                        </ol>
